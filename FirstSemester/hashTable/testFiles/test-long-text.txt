The unnamed Narrator, an insomniac but otherwise healthy man dissatisfied with his job and lifestyle, attends support groups for problems such as alcoholism and cancer as a substitute for therapy. His efforts are disrupted when another impostor, Marla Singer, joins the same groups. Viewing her as a mirror to his own deceit, he arranges for them to attend different sessions, to which she reluctantly agrees. On a return flight from work, the Narrator meets soap salesman Tyler Durden, who critiques his consumerist lifestyle. After an explosion destroys his apartment, he moves into Tyler's decrepit house as a last resort. Via their budding friendship, they start an underground fight club in a bar basement. Tyler also saves Marla from an overdose, initiating a sexual relationship between them, while the Narrator remains cold to her. The Narrator quits his job, blackmails his boss for funds, and grows Fight Club, attracting new members including his cancer support group friend, Bob. Tyler morphs the club into Project Mayhem, committing acts of vandalism intended to disrupt the social order. Feeling sidelined, the Narrator confronts Tyler, who admits to orchestrating the explosion in the Narrator's apartment, and then goes missing. When Bob is killed by police during a mission, the Narrator tries to dismantle Project Mayhem. Discovering its nationwide reach, and being called Tyler Durden by Marla and members, he realizes he and Tyler are split personalities. Learning that Tyler plans to erase debt records by blowing up the skyscrapers of consumer credit companies, the Narrator unsuccessfully warns Marla and goes to the police, some of whom are also Project Mayhem members. He attempts to disarm the explosives, but Tyler attacks him. Accepting that he himself is Tyler, he shoots himself in the head, "killing" Tyler, while the bullet non-fatally passes through the Narrator's cheek. Marla arrives, and the two hold hands as they watch as the targeted buildings collapse.
